Traditional Mean-Variance Model (MV):
 is based on two key factors:
Expected Returns (Mean): Maximizing expected returns.
Risk (Variance): Minimizing portfolio variance.
It seeks an optimal allocation of limited capital among available financial assets, balancing risk and reward.
Mean-VaR Portfolio Optimization:
In the alternative approach, we replace the variance with Value-at-Risk (VaR), an industry-standard risk measure.
VaR quantifies the maximum potential loss a portfolio may incur over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.
By incorporating VaR, we gain insights into extreme downside risk, which is crucial for risk management.
Challenges and Solution:
Realistic portfolio optimization using VaR is complex due to its non-convex, NP-hard nature.
Optimizing VaR directly is computationally intractable.
To address this, an efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MODE-GL) has been proposed.
MODE-GL tackles real-world constraints (e.g., cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment, round-lot, and class constraints) while optimizing mean-VaR portfolios.
It promotes efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search toward promising regions of the solution space.
Experimental Results:
Historical daily financial market data from S&P 100 and S&P 500 indices were used.
MODE-GL outperformed existing techniques (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm) in terms of solution quality and computational time.
The proposed algorithm provides complex portfolio optimization without simplifications, yielding good solutions within reasonable timeframes.
In summary, the mean-VaR framework offers a valuable perspective on market risk exposure, allowing investors to make informed decisions while considering extreme events.
